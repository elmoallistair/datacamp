## Context Managers

If you've ever seen the "with" keyword in Python and wondered what its deal was, then this is the chapter for you! Context managers are a convenient way to provide connections in Python and guarantee that those connections get cleaned up when you are done using them. This chapter will show you how to use context managers, as well as how to write your own.

### The number of cats

```
# Open "alice.txt" and assign the file to "file"
with open('alice.txt') as file:
  text = file.read()

n = 0
for word in text.split():
  if word.lower() in ['cat', 'cats']:
    n += 1

print('Lewis Carroll uses the word "cat" {} times'.format(n))
```

### The speed of cats

```
image = get_image_from_instagram()

# Time how long process_with_numpy(image) takes to run
with timer():
  print('Numpy version')
  process_with_numpy(image)

# Time how long process_with_pytorch(image) takes to run
with timer():
  print('Pytorch version')
  process_with_pytorch(image)
```

### The timer() context manager

```
# Add a decorator that will make timer() a context manager
@contextlib.contextmanager
def timer():
  """Time the execution of a context block.

  Yields:
    None
  """
  start = time.time()
  # Send control back to the context block
  yield
  end = time.time()
  print('Elapsed: {:.2f}s'.format(end - start))

with timer():
  print('This should take approximately 0.25 seconds')
  time.sleep(0.25)
```

### A read-only open() context manager

```
@contextlib.contextmanager
def open_read_only(filename):
  """Open a file in read-only mode.

  Args:
    filename (str): The location of the file to read

  Yields:
    file object
  """
  read_only_file = open(filename, mode='r')
  # Yield read_only_file so it can be assigned to my_file
  yield read_only_file
  # Close read_only_file
  read_only_file.close()

with open_read_only('my_file.txt') as my_file:
  print(my_file.read())
```

### Scraping the NASDAQ

```
# Use the "stock('NVDA')" context manager
# and assign the result to the variable "nvda"
with stock("NVDA") as nvda:
  # Open "NVDA.txt" for writing as f_out
  with open("NVDA.txt", "w") as f_out:
    for _ in range(10):
      value = nvda.price()
      print('Logging ${:.2f} for NVDA'.format(value))
      f_out.write('{:.2f}\n'.format(value))
```

### Changing the working directory

```
def in_dir(directory):
  """Change current working directory to `directory`,
  allow the user to run some code, and change back.

  Args:
    directory (str): The path to a directory to work in.
  """
  current_dir = os.getcwd()
  os.chdir(directory)

  # Add code that lets you handle errors
  try:
    yield
  # Ensure the directory is reset,
  # whether there was an error or not
  finally:
    os.chdir(current_dir)
```
