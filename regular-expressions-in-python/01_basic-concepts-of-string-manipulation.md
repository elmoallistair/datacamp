## Basic Concepts of String Manipulation

Start your journey into the regular expression world! From slicing and concatenating, adjusting the case, removing spaces, to finding and replacing strings. You will learn how to master basic operation for string manipulation using a movie review dataset.

<br>

### First day!

```
# Find characters in movie variable
length_string = len(movie)

# Convert to string
to_string = str(length_string)

# Predefined variable
statement = "Number of characters in this review:"

# Concatenate strings and print result
print(statement + " " + to_string)
```

### Artificial reviews

```
# Select the first 32 characters of movie1
first_part = movie1[:32]

# Select from 43rd character to the end of movie1
last_part = movie1[42:]

# Select from 33rd to the 42nd character
middle_part = movie2[32:42]

# Print concatenation and movie2 variable
print(first_part+middle_part+last_part) 
print(movie2)
```

### Palindromes

```
# Get the word
movie_title = movie[11:30]

# Obtain the palindrome
palindrome = movie_title[::-1]

# Print the word if it's a palindrome
if movie_title == palindrome:
	print(movie_title)
```

### Normalizing reviews

```
# Convert to lowercase and print the result
movie_lower = movie.lower()
print(movie_lower)

# Remove specified character and print the result
movie_no_sign = movie_lower.strip("$")
print(movie_no_sign)

# Split the string into substrings and print the result
movie_split = movie_no_sign.split()
print(movie_split)

# Select root word and print the result
word_root = movie_split[1][:-1]
print(word_root)
```

### Time to join!

```
# Remove tags happening at the end and print results
movie_tag = movie.rstrip("<\i>")
print(movie_tag)

# Split the string using commas and print results
movie_no_comma = movie_tag.split(",")
print(movie_no_comma)

# Join back together and print results
movie_join = " ".join(movie_no_comma)
print(movie_join)
```

### Split lines or split the line?

```
# Split string at line boundaries
file_split = file.splitlines()

# Print file_split
print(file_split)

# Complete for-loop to split by commas
for substring in file_split:
    substring_split = substring.split(",")
    print(substring_split)
```

### Finding a substring

```
for movie in movies:
  	# Find if actor occurrs between 37 and 41 inclusive
    if movie.find("actor", 37, 42) == -1:
        print("Word not found")
    # Count occurrences and replace two by one
    elif movie.count("actor") == 2:  
        print(movie.replace("actor actor", "actor"))
    else:
        # Replace three occurrences by one
        print(movie.replace("actor actor actor", "actor"))
```

### Where's the word?

```
for movie in movies:
  try:
    # Find the first occurrence of word
  	print(movie.index('money', 12, 51))
  except ValueError:
    print("substring not found")
```

### Replacing negations

```
# Replace negations 
movies_no_negation = movies.replace("isn't", "is")

# Replace important
movies_antonym = movies_no_negation.replace("important", "insignificant")

# Print out
print(movies_antonym)
```
